# NVIM configuration

This is my configuration folder for **NeoVim**.
Since the integration of **Lua** with NeoVim version >0.5 to enable configuration and the fact, that I never was bothered to really learn **VimScript**, I decided to try relying on Lua as much as possible.

# I want your config, because I want it

If the above is **really** the case you should just be able to clone this repository and use it as your NeoVim configuration folder.
Under normal circumstances this would be in `$HOME/.config/nvim`.
After cloning and launching NeoVim (remember you need to have a version >0.5) simply issue a `:PlugInstall` and it *shouldâ„¢* work after another restart.
